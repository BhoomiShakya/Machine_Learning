#### Key Features Analyzed:
- **Airlines**: Multiple airline carriers
- **Routes**: Source and destination cities
- **Timing**: Departure and arrival times, journey dates
- **Duration**: Flight duration and number of stops
- **Pricing**: Target variable for prediction

#### Data Processing Steps:
1. **Date Feature Engineering**: 
   - Extracted day, month, year from journey dates
   - Converted date components to integer format
2. **Time Feature Engineering**:
   - Split departure and arrival times into hour and minute components
   - Handled time format inconsistencies
3. **Categorical Encoding**:
   - Applied One-Hot Encoding to airline, source, and destination variables
   - Mapped stop categories to numerical values (non-stop=0, 1 stop=1, etc.)
4. **Duration Processing**:
   - Extracted hours and minutes from duration strings
   - Converted to separate numerical features
5. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values in Route and Total_Stops columns
   - Removed redundant columns after feature extraction

#### Final Dataset Structure:
- **Original**: 11 columns, 10,683 rows
- **Processed**: 16+ columns with engineered features, ready for machine learning

   - Handled missing values across multiple features
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Converted Reviews from string to integer
   - Standardized Size format (M/k to numerical values)
   - Cleaned Price and Installs columns (removed $, +, commas)
   - Extracted year, month, day from Last Updated dates
3. **Data Export**: Created cleaned dataset (`cleanDataCSV/google_cleaned.csv`)

#### Key Insights:
- **App Distribution**: Family apps (18.2%) and Games (10.6%) dominate the market
- **Pricing**: 92.6% of apps are free
- **Content Rating**: 80.4% apps rated "Everyone"
- **Market Analysis**: Category-wise installation patterns and rating distributions

#### Visualizations Created:
- Univariate analysis of numerical features (KDE plots)
- Categorical feature distributions (count plots)
- Top 10 app categories (pie chart and bar plot)
- Market share analysis by category

### 3. Wine Quality Assessment (`Winequality_01.ipynb`)

**Dataset**: Portuguese Vinho Verde wine quality data with 1,599 records  
**Source**: `wine+quality/winequality-red.csv`  
**Objective**: Analyze physicochemical properties and their relationship with wine quality

#### Dataset Information:
- **Wine Type**: Red wine samples from Portuguese "Vinho Verde"
- **Attributes**: 11 physicochemical properties + quality rating
- **Quality Scale**: 0-10 (based on expert sensory evaluation)

#### Features Analyzed:
1. **Acidity Metrics**: Fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid
2. **Sugar Content**: Residual sugar
3. **Chemical Properties**: Chlorides, sulfur dioxide (free/total)
4. **Physical Properties**: Density, pH, sulphates, alcohol content
5. **Target Variable**: Quality score (0-10)

#### Analysis Techniques:
1. **Data Quality**:
   - Removed duplicate records (1599 ‚Üí 1359 records)
   - Verified no missing values
2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Descriptive statistics for all features
   - Correlation analysis with heatmap visualization
   - Distribution analysis using histograms
3. **Quality Assessment**:
   - Imbalanced dataset analysis (quality distribution)
   - Feature correlation with quality scores
   - Box plots for quality vs. alcohol content

#### Key Findings:
- **Quality Distribution**: Dataset is imbalanced with most wines rated 5-6
- **Feature Correlations**: Strong relationships between certain chemical properties
- **Quality Factors**: Alcohol content and other physicochemical properties influence quality ratings
