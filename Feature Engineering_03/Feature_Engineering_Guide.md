## Introduction to Feature Engineering

Feature Engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data. It is often considered the most important step in the machine learning pipeline, as the quality of features directly impacts model performance.

### Why Feature Engineering Matters
- **Improves Model Performance**: Well-engineered features can significantly boost model accuracy
- **Reduces Overfitting**: Proper feature engineering helps models generalize better
- **Handles Real-World Data**: Raw data often contains missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
- **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Allows incorporation of business logic and domain expertise

## Handling Missing Values

Missing values are one of the most common issues in real-world datasets. Understanding and properly handling them is crucial for building robust machine learning models.

### Types of Missing Values

#### 1. MCAR (Missing Completely at Random)
- Missing values are random and independent of any other variables
- No pattern in the missingness
- Example: Random data corruption

#### 2. MAR (Missing at Random)
- Missing values depend on observed data but not on the missing values themselves
- Pattern exists but is explainable
- Example: Income missing more often for unemployed people

#### 3. MNAR (Missing Not at Random)
- Missing values depend on the unobserved values themselves
- Most problematic type
- Example: People with high income less likely to report income

### Common Techniques

#### 1. Deletion Methods
**Listwise Deletion (Complete Case Analysis)**
```python
df.dropna(inplace=True)
```
- **Pros**: Simple, no assumptions needed
- **Cons**: Loss of information, potential bias

**Pairwise Deletion**
```python
df.dropna(axis=1, inplace=True)
```
- **Pros**: Retains more data
- **Cons**: Different sample sizes for different analyses

#### 2. Imputation Methods

**Mean Imputation**
```python
df['age'].fillna(df['age'].mean())
```
- Best for: Normally distributed numerical data
- **Pros**: Preserves mean, simple
- **Cons**: Reduces variance, may not be realistic

**Median Imputation**
```python
df['age'].fillna(df['age'].median())
```
- Best for: Skewed numerical data
- **Pros**: Robust to outliers
- **Cons**: Still reduces variance

**Mode Imputation**
```python
df['category'].fillna(df['category'].mode()[0])
```
- Best for: Categorical data
- **Pros**: Preserves most common category
- **Cons**: May not represent true distribution

### Advanced Methods
- **KNN Imputation**: Use k-nearest neighbors to predict missing values
- **Iterative Imputation**: Use other features to predict missing values
- **Multiple Imputation**: Create multiple datasets with different imputations

### Best Practices
1. Always analyze the pattern of missingness first
2. Choose method based on data type and missing pattern
3. Consider the impact on model performance
4. Document your imputation strategy
5. Validate results on test data

## Outlier Detection and Handling

Outliers are data points that significantly differ from other observations and can have a substantial impact on statistical analysis and machine learning models.

### Understanding Outliers

**What are Outliers?**
- Data points that are unusually far from other observations
- Can be caused by measurement errors, data entry mistakes, or genuine extreme values
- Can significantly impact model performance and statistical measures

### 5-Number Summary

The 5-number summary provides a quick overview of data distribution:
- **Minimum**: Smallest value
- **Q1 (First Quartile)**: 25th percentile
- **Median (Q2)**: 50th percentile (middle value)
- **Q3 (Third Quartile)**: 75th percentile
- **Maximum**: Largest value

### Interquartile Range (IQR)
- IQR = Q3 - Q1
- Measures the spread of the middle 50% of data
- Used as a basis for outlier detection

### Outlier Detection Methods

#### 1. IQR Method
```python
Q1 = np.quantile(data, 0.25)
Q3 = np.quantile(data, 0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
lower_fence = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_fence = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
```
- Values outside [lower_fence, upper_fence] are considered outliers
- **Pros**: Robust to extreme outliers
- **Cons**: May miss outliers in skewed distributions

#### 2. Z-Score Method
```python
z_scores = np.abs((data - data.mean()) / data.std())
outliers = data[z_scores > 3]
```
- Values with |Z-score| > 3 are considered outliers
- **Pros**: Works well for normal distributions
- **Cons**: Sensitive to extreme outliers

#### 3. Box Plot Visualization
- Visual representation of 5-number summary
- Outliers appear as individual points beyond whiskers
- Great for initial exploration

### Handling Outliers

#### 1. Remove
```python
data_clean = data[(data >= lower_fence) & (data <= upper_fence)]
```
- **When to use**: Clear measurement errors
- **Pros**: Clean dataset
- **Cons**: Loss of information

#### 2. Cap (Winsorization)
```python
data_capped = np.clip(data, lower_fence, upper_fence)
```
- **When to use**: Suspected measurement errors
- **Pros**: Retains data points
- **Cons**: May not reflect true distribution

#### 3. Transform
```python
data_log = np.log1p(data)  # Log transformation
data_sqrt = np.sqrt(data)  # Square root transformation
```
- **When to use**: Skewed distributions
- **Pros**: Reduces impact of outliers
- **Cons**: Changes interpretation

#### 4. Investigate
- Understand if outliers are genuine or errors
- Use domain knowledge
- Consider business context

### Best Practices
1. Always investigate outliers before removing them
2. Consider the business context and domain knowledge
3. Use multiple methods to detect outliers
4. Document your outlier treatment approach
5. Validate the impact on model performance

## Categorical Encoding Techniques

Categorical variables need to be converted to numerical format for most machine learning algorithms. The choice of encoding method depends on the nature of the categorical variable and the algorithm being used.

### Types of Categorical Variables

#### 1. Nominal Variables
- Categories with no inherent order
- Examples: colors, cities, brands, gender
- No meaningful ranking between categories

#### 2. Ordinal Variables
- Categories with meaningful order/ranking
- Examples: size (small < medium < large), education level, satisfaction rating
- Order matters for the analysis

### Encoding Techniques

#### 1. Label Encoding
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoded = encoder.fit_transform(df['category'])
```

**What it does:**
- Assigns integer values (0, 1, 2, ...) to categories
- Simple and memory efficient

**When to use:**
- Ordinal categorical variables
- Tree-based algorithms
- When you have a clear ordering

**Limitations:**
- Can introduce artificial ordinality in nominal data
- May mislead algorithms about category relationships

#### 2. One-Hot Encoding
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
encoder = OneHotEncoder()
encoded = encoder.fit_transform(df[['category']]).toarray()
```

**What it does:**
- Creates binary columns for each category
- Each category becomes a separate column (0 or 1)

**When to use:**
- Nominal categorical variables
- Linear models and neural networks
- Small number of unique categories

**Advantages:**
- No artificial ordinality
- Each category treated equally
- Works well with most algorithms

**Limitations:**
- Curse of dimensionality
- Not suitable for high-cardinality variables

#### 3. Ordinal Encoding
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder
encoder = OrdinalEncoder(categories=[['small', 'medium', 'large']])
encoded = encoder.fit_transform(df[['size']])
```

**What it does:**
- Assigns integers based on specified order
- Preserves ordinal relationships

**When to use:**
- Ordinal categorical variables
- When order matters for the model
- Tree-based algorithms

**Advantages:**
- Maintains ordinal relationships
- You control the order assignment
- More informative than simple label encoding

#### 4. Target-Guided Encoding
```python
mean_target = df.groupby('category')['target'].mean().to_dict()
df['category_encoded'] = df['category'].map(mean_target)
```

**What it does:**
- Uses target variable to encode categories
- Replaces categories with aggregated statistics

**When to use:**
- High-cardinality categorical variables
- When you want to capture target-category relationships
- Regression problems

**Advantages:**
- Captures relationship with target
- Handles high-cardinality well
- Can improve model performance

**Best Practices:**
- Use cross-validation to prevent overfitting
- Consider smoothing for rare categories
- Monitor for data leakage

### Choosing the Right Encoding Method

| Variable Type | Algorithm Type | Recommended Encoding |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Nominal | Linear/Neural | One-Hot Encoding |
| Nominal | Tree-based | Label Encoding |
| Ordinal | Any | Ordinal Encoding |
| High-cardinality | Any | Target-Guided Encoding |

## Handling Imbalanced Datasets

Class imbalance is a common problem in machine learning where one class has significantly more samples than others, leading to biased models.

### Understanding Class Imbalance

**What is Class Imbalance?**
- One class has significantly more samples than others
- Common in real-world datasets (fraud detection, medical diagnosis, etc.)
- Can lead to models that favor the majority class

**Problems with Imbalanced Datasets:**
1. Models tend to predict majority class more often
2. Poor performance on minority class (low recall)
3. Misleading accuracy metrics
4. Biased model evaluation

### Techniques to Handle Imbalance

#### 1. Resampling Methods

**Random Oversampling**
```python
from sklearn.utils import resample
minority_upsample = resample(minority_class, 
                           replace=True, 
                           n_samples=len(majority_class),
                           random_state=42)
```

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement
- No information loss

**Cons:**
- Can lead to overfitting
- May not improve generalization

**Random Undersampling**
```python
majority_downsample = resample(majority_class,
                             replace=False,
                             n_samples=len(minority_class),
                             random_state=42)
```

**Pros:**
- Reduces computational cost
- Balances classes

**Cons:**
- Loss of information
- May remove important samples

#### 2. Advanced Resampling

**SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**
- Generates synthetic samples for minority class
- Creates new examples between existing minority samples
- Reduces overfitting compared to simple oversampling

**ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)**
- Adaptive version of SMOTE
- Focuses on difficult-to-learn samples
- Better for highly imbalanced datasets

#### 3. Algorithm-Level Approaches

**Cost-Sensitive Learning**
- Assign different costs to different classes
- Penalize misclassification of minority class more heavily

**Threshold Tuning**
- Adjust classification threshold
- Optimize for specific metrics (F1-score, precision, recall)

**Ensemble Methods**
- Balanced bagging
- Balanced boosting
- Combine multiple models

### Evaluation Metrics for Imbalanced Data

**Traditional Metrics (Can be Misleading):**
- Accuracy: (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
- Can be high even with poor minority class performance

**Better Metrics:**
- **Precision**: TP / (TP + FP) - How many predicted positives are actually positive
- **Recall**: TP / (TP + FN) - How many actual positives are correctly identified
- **F1-Score**: 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall) - Harmonic mean
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under ROC curve - Overall discriminative ability
- **PR-AUC**: Area under Precision-Recall curve - Better for imbalanced data

### Best Practices
1. Use appropriate evaluation metrics
2. Consider the business cost of different types of errors
3. Try multiple techniques and compare results
4. Validate on unseen data
5. Consider computational cost of resampling
6. Use cross-validation with stratification

## SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

SMOTE is one of the most popular and effective techniques for handling imbalanced datasets by generating synthetic samples for the minority class.

### What is SMOTE?

**Definition:**
- SMOTE creates synthetic examples of the minority class
- Works by interpolating between existing minority class samples
- Generates new samples in the feature space

**How SMOTE Works:**
1. Select a minority class sample
2. Find its k-nearest neighbors in the minority class
3. Create synthetic samples along the line between the sample and its neighbors
4. Repeat until desired balance is achieved

### Implementation

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# Initialize SMOTE
oversample = SMOTE()

# Apply to dataset
X_resampled, y_resampled = oversample.fit_resample(X, y)
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Reduces Overfitting**: Creates more realistic synthetic samples compared to simple duplication
2. **Improves Minority Class Performance**: Better recall for minority class
3. **Maintains Data Distribution**: Preserves the original data characteristics
4. **Flexible**: Can control the degree of oversampling

### When to Use SMOTE

**Ideal Scenarios:**
- Severely imbalanced datasets
- When simple oversampling leads to overfitting
- Need to improve recall for minority class
- Working with numerical features

**Limitations:**
- Works best with numerical features
- May not work well with high-dimensional data
- Can create noise if not applied carefully
- May not preserve complex relationships

### SMOTE Variants

**Borderline-SMOTE:**
- Focuses on borderline samples
- Better for datasets with overlapping classes

**ADASYN:**
- Adaptive synthetic sampling
- Generates more samples in difficult regions

**SMOTE-NC:**
- Handles both numerical and categorical features
- Uses nearest neighbor approach for mixed data types

### Best Practices for SMOTE

1. **Apply to Training Data Only**: Never apply to test data
2. **Use Cross-Validation**: Validate performance with proper CV
3. **Consider Feature Scaling**: SMOTE works better with scaled features
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check if SMOTE actually improves model performance
5. **Combine with Other Techniques**: Sometimes works better with undersampling

### Example Workflow

```python
# 1. Split data first
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 2. Apply SMOTE only to training data
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

# 3. Train model on resampled data
model.fit(X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled)

# 4. Evaluate on original test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```
