# Customer Behavior Analysis & Segmentation

## 📖 Project Overview
This project explores customer demographics, purchase patterns, and churn prediction to provide actionable business insights. The analysis supports marketing strategies and customer retention efforts, with a strong focus on learning and practical data science workflows.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure & Notebooks
The project is organized as a series of Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on a key aspect of the data analysis process:

- **numpy_01.ipynb**: Introduction to NumPy for numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **pandas_02.ipynb**: Data wrangling and preprocessing using pandas.
- **dataManipulation_03.ipynb**: Advanced data manipulation techniques and feature engineering.
- **readData04.ipynb**: Reading and initial exploration of CSV data files.
- **DataVisualization_Seaborn_06.ipynb**: Data visualization using Seaborn for statistical graphics.
- **DataVisualization_Matplotlib_07.ipynb**: Data visualization using Matplotlib for custom plots.

> **Note:** CSV data files are included in the project root for convenience.

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- plotly

Install all dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository and install the requirements.
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code.
3. Run the notebooks in any order for learning, or follow this suggested progression:
   1. `numpy_01.ipynb`
   2. `pandas_02.ipynb`
   3. `dataManipulation_03.ipynb`
   4. `readData04.ipynb`
   5. `DataVisualization_Seaborn_06.ipynb`
   6. `DataVisualization_Matplotlib_07.ipynb`

> For interactive Plotly charts, enable widgets in your Jupyter environment.

## 📊 Results & Outputs
- Cleaned datasets, summary tables, and visualizations are displayed within the notebooks.
- Some charts may be saved as images if code is provided, but the primary focus is on in-notebook results and learning.
